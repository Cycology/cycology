Changed Functions:

xmp_getattr

xmp_fgetattr

xmp_unlink

xmp_link

xmp_chmod

xmp_chown

xmp_utimens (but ultimately ended up confused)

xmp_create

xmp_open

xmp_release

Notes:
xmp_access didn't change, but has to in the future, since we can't actually keep mode the same for the mini files
xmp_mknod is the same, except it now checks if the file is regular, and prints an error message if it is
I pasted our read into xmp_read, along with your read, but din't do much else. A similar situation with xmp_write. I didn't touch the truncates.
I was confused about what xmp_flush should do.
